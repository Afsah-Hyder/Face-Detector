# Face-Detector
This Python code provides face detection capabilities that can be applied to images, videos, or real-time scenarios. However, the existing pre-built algorithms for face detection lack the required accuracy for real-life applications. These algorithms struggle to detect faces that are tilted or have lighting variations. To address this limitation, I aim to leverage Deep Learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of face detection.
